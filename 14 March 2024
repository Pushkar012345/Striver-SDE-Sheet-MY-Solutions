Given a string, remove spaces from it. 

Example 1:

Input:
S = "geeks  for geeks"
Output: geeksforgeeks
Explanation: All the spaces have been 
removed.
Example 2:

Input: 
S = "    g f g"
Output: gfg
Explanation: All the spaces including
the leading ones have been removed.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function modify() which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string by removing all the white spaces from S.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

public:
    string modify (string s)
    {
        string ans;
        
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            if(s[i]!=' ')
            {
                ans=ans+s[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
